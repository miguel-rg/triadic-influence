it contains the social network (weighted and directed) of the relationships in 13 middle schools in Spain, containing 3395 students and 60566 relationships.


The paper contains two parts corresponding to different parts of the paper: a first one corresponding to the importance of triadic influence to link prediction in social network analysis; and a second one where we use embedding theory.

For the second part, we include a sample program to represent the process done during the paper, where accuracy measures for the different treatments can be obtained given different school datasets.
